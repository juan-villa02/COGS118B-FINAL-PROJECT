# COGS118B-FINAL-PROJECT

Final Project for the course COGS 118B - Introduction to Machine Learning II

__Authors__: Juan Villanueva Romero and Álvaro Maza Montesinos

__Group number__: 34

### Abstract

The main goal of this project consists on performing image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). One of our biggest motivations to focus on image classification is to get a deeper knowledge about Neural Networks, which have been introduced as a topic in class, but have not been put into practice in our homeworks.

For this project, we used Python as the programming language, importing some libraries like numpy for array manipulation, pandas, matplotlib for plots, and Tensorflow/Keras to build the Convolutional Neural Networks.

### Guidelines

All the code we wrote to analyse the dataset and create our final Convolutional Neural Network is included and explained in the Jupyter Notebook. Aditionally, there is a python script which can be runned separately once the whole notebook has been completely runned. It executes a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) to test the performance of our model. __The required packages for that script are__:


- Tkinter 
- Keras -> keras.model
- PIL -> ImageGrab
- numpy
- matplotlib

Also, since we were not able to perfectly track the movement of the window opened by the API, make sure the canvas is situated between values 200 and 500 with respect to x and y coordinates.
